\section{Large language model usage}
A major part of this master thesis is to include \ac{LLM} such as ChatGPT in the data clump refactoring pipeline. 

To allow the use of a \ac{LLM}, some considerations needs to be made. This includes \enquote{prompt engineering}, \enquote{input engineering}\enquote{usage reduction}, and   \enquote{output parsing}. These steps will be outlined in the following:

\subsection{Prompt engineering}


In order to use a \ac{LLM} more effectively, the prompts and queries need to be modeled in a specific manner so that they are interpreted correctly. While deviating from these manners may still produce correct result, it nevertheless increases the risk of wrong results. The following tipps were derived from the OpenAI documentation \cite{ChatGPT_url} and hence apply only to ChatGPT. Generally speaking however, many recommendation will work for other \ac{LLM} too because they will help to make the prompt more clearly and prevent misunderstanding:

\subsubsection{Separate instruction and input}
Many queries to \ac{LLM}
