This chapter deals with the design of the program. It provides information about the processing pipeline (\ref{sec:pipeline} and how the different parts of that pipeline can be modeled in a way that allows easy extension. This is expanded by the context that stores the data of each step (section (\ref{sec:context}). Then, the integration of \ac{LLM} like ChatGPT will be analyzed.
