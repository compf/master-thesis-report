\chapter{Implementation}

In this chapter, the the design choices and considerations discussed in chapter \ref{chapter:conception} will be implemented. Firstly, in section \ref{sec:config}, the configuration of the tool is explained. After that experiments are performed in order to find out how ChatGPT can be integrated for data clump finding ( see section \ref{sec:prompt_engineering_impl}). In section \ref{sec:step_impl} an overview will be given which combination of tools can be used together to find and refactor data clumps and the limitation and strengths of each combination will be outlined.
