\section{Code smells}\label{sec:code_smell}

The term \enquote{Code smell} is suggested by Kent Beck in \cite{fowler2019refactoring} for source code that may need refactoring. If the refactoring is not performed on time, the costs of maintenance of the source code and the software project can be higher, and the efficiency of implementing changes is reduced. Some examples of code smells include unclear variable names, large classes, oversized methods, missing documentation, or code duplicates. 

Different types of code smells can be distinguished \cite{data_clumps_refactoring_guru}:
\begin{description}
    \item [Bloaters] Code smells increases the code size unnecessarily 
    \item [Change Preventers] A code smell that makes it harder to apply changes to the source code because many files are affected by a small change
    \item [Dispensables] Source code that can be easily removed without affecting the functionality
