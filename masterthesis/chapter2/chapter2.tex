In this chapter, the background of data clumps will be discussed. A formal definition of code smells is given in \ref{sec:code_smell}. Then, section \ref{sec:data_clump_def} focues on a formal definition of data clumps and their refactoring while also outlining the challenges of this task.

The concept of large language models are discussed in section \ref{sec:llm}. Here, the potentials but also the challenges of these models are outlined providing an overview of what a practitioner must be aware of.

In the end, related tools and related research will be discussed in section \ref{sec:related_research}.

\section{Related work}
Since refactoring code smells is becoming increasingly important for developers, a variety of research has been conducted to study how the refactoring process can be improved.

Furthermore, tools have been developed that on their own cannot refactor code smells but can be adapted and used to ease developing refactoring tools.

Additionally, the use of \ac{LLM} in software development has recently gained widespread attention and has become a focus of several studies which analyzes the potential and challenges in practice.
