In this chapter, the relevant background for the issues that are dealt with in this master's thesis is outlined. 

Firstly, the general topic of code smells is discussed. Different categories of code smells and their impact on the ease on refactoring are discussed  \ref{sec:code_smell}. This general introduction is followed by  section \ref{sec:data_clump_def} which  specifically focuses on the code smell known as data clumps. Here, the issues regarding code smells  are concretized for data clumps to underline the unique challenges of refactoring them.

To overcome these challenges, the master's thesis will focus on \acp{LLM} like ChatGPT. This concept is discussed in section \ref{sec:llm}. Here, the potentials but also the challenges of these models are outlined providing an overview of what a practitioner must be aware of.

In the end, related work  will be discussed in section \ref{sec:related_research} to give an overview about the impact of data clumps, and how \acp{LLM} are already used for refactoring.
